# Warehouse-Inventory
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this application was to allow warehouse workers to be able to have the ability to track inventory as it enters and exits the warehouse. 
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens that were necessary was the initial sign in screen, which allowed users to enter username and password to gain entry. The inventory screen allows users to observe the initial inventory and it allows them to increase or decrease the inventory based on what goes in and out. The UI was very simple and fluid and very direct. My designs were successful because I covered all the basis of what an inventory app requires. 
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached this process by creating containers on my UI and designing each container individually therefore giving me the room to add or delete a container while designing them appropriately. These techniques can be applied in the future because there must be some form of organization and a game plan of approach.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
To test the code I use Android Studio because it has a built-in Android emulator that allows you to run and debug apps in different environments. This process is important because you want to ensure that you have functioning code for the customer. 
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
To be honest I had to innovate through the entire process, which made me a better developer because I had to read, research, Google, and use YouTube to get me through this project. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I showed a strong knowledge in coding, though I was not familiar with python, I do right in Java and JavaScript which allowed me to understand the coding process quickly.
